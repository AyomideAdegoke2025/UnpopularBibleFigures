        <h2>The Story of Cain and Abel</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Who Was Cain?</h3>
            <p>
                Cain was the firstborn son of Adam and Eve, the first human beings in the Bible. His story is one of jealousy, sin, and the consequences of making the wrong choices. He is best known for committing the first murder in biblical history by killing his brother, Abel.

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Offering to God</h3>
            <p>
                Cain and his brother Abel were both asked to offer sacrifices to God. Cain, who was a farmer, offered produce from his land, while Abel, a shepherd, offered the best lamb from his flock. God accepted Abel’s offering, but rejected Cain’s. This led Cain to feel angry and rejected, eventually resulting in the tragic act of murdering his brother.

        <div class="section">
            <h3>God's Judgment and Mercy</h3>
            <p>
                After Cain killed Abel, God confronted him and cursed him to wander as a fugitive. Despite Cain’s grave sin, God showed mercy by placing a mark on him to protect him from being killed by others. The story highlights themes of sin, punishment, and the possibility of redemption.

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Legacy of Cain</h3>
            <p>
                The story of Cain and Abel serves as a reminder of the dangers of jealousy, pride, and not offering one’s best to God. It teaches us about the consequences of our actions and how God's judgment is tempered with mercy. Cain's legacy lives on as a symbol of human failings, but also of God's patience.
